A project for the module CSC2022 from Newcastle University Team 20. 

Seaton Valley Council App supplies residents and tourists with information about 
Seaton Valley as well as acting as a platform to contact the council about any issues. 
The eight key features allow users to find information regarding Seaton Valley Council,
their social media, local news and upcoming events, details about the area and 
any nearby attractions such as restaurants and coffee shops.
These features accommodate the needs of both the residents of Seaton Valley, 
allowing them to report any problems and find out what is happening in their area, 
as well as allowing tourists to find out a bit more about the villages 
and easily find nearby things to do.
