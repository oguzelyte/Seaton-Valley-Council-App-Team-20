The population is around 3,000 people. The village has an attractive setting at the mouth of Seaton Burn, with a historic harbour, a fine sandy beach and dunes, and the open space of Holywell Dene nearby. It is also the closest village to Seaton Delaval Hall, a National Trust property. As a result, Seaton Sluice is both an attractive residential area, and a popular visitor destination. Village facilities include two schools (Seaton Sluice First School and Seaton Sluice Middle School), a community centre and library, post office, several shops, cafes, pubs and social clubs, and two churches. The village has significant industrial heritage, linked to the Delaval family, as highlighted by the Local History Society.</string>

Village facilities include a school (Holywell First School), a small community centre, a small shop, two pubs and a church (St Mary’s).</string>

    <string name="council_about_title">About Seaton Valley Council</string>
    <string name="council_about">\nSeaton Valley Council, first came into being on 1st April 2009, following local government review in Northumberland which saw the then six District Councils in Northumberland, and the County Council merge into one Council for the whole of Northumberland.\n\nAs part of this process a number of new Parish Councils were created throughout Northumberland to provide localised services and to account for these services to their communities.\n\nSince 2009 Seaton Valley Council has taken on a number of responsibilities from the County Council because both Councils have decided that these services are better provided locally.\n</string>
